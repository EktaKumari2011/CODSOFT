# <h1>CodSoft Internship Repository</h1>

Welcome to the CodSoft Internship Repository! This repository tracks the progress and showcases the projects completed during my 1-month internship at CodSoft.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Throughout the internship, I will be working on five distinct projects aimed at applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems. Each project will be implemented using Python and its libraries, leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>1.Titanic Survival Prediction Model</h3>

Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.
Requirements:
Dataset: Titanic dataset containing passenger information.
Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Implementation of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

<h3>2.Movie Rating Prediction</h3>

Objective: Build a predictive model to forecast movie ratings based on various features.
Requirements:
Dataset: Movie dataset with movie details and user ratings.
Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Implementation of regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, etc.

<h3>3.Iris Flower Classification</h3>

Objective: Develop a classification model to classify iris flower species based on features like petal length, petal width, etc.
Requirements:
Dataset: Iris dataset containing measurements of iris flowers.
Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Application of classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, etc.

<h3>4.Sales Prediction</h3>

Objective: Predict future sales for a retail company based on historical sales data.
Requirements:
Dataset: Sales dataset with historical sales data.
Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Time series analysis techniques and forecasting algorithms.

<h3>5.Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>

Objective: Develop a model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Requirements:
Dataset: Credit card transactions dataset with labeled fraudulent transactions.
Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Implementation of anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, etc.

<h2>Completion Criteria</h2>

To be eligible for the completion certificate, I am required to successfully complete three out of the five projects listed above. Progress on each project will be tracked and documented in this repository.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I am excited to embark on this journey of learning and growth during my internship at CodSoft. Through these projects, I aim to enhance my skills in Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning while contributing meaningful solutions to real-world problems.

Let's get started and make the most out of this internship experience! ðŸš€
